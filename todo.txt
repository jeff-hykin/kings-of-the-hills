// instead of complete randomness
    // look at the top __ number of citizens 
    // extrapolate a good direction and good step size from those steps
    // then use that as a baseline for a normal-random numbers in that direction
    // change the amount of standard deviation based on the rate of improvement in the last few steps
        // if improvements/lack of improvments are consistant for several steps for a kingdom, then increase the step size
        // if improvements are radically changing for the last several steps, then decrease the step size
// change the distance reward to be equivlent to being outside of the range of the existing kingdoms (the gaussian normal space theyre in)
// consider making the number of kings dynamic
